In Natural Language Processing (NLP), vectorizing text refers to the process of converting
 text data (which is inherently unstructured and not machine-readable) into numerical 
 representations that machine learning models can process.

 Why Vectorize Text?
	1.	Machine Learning Compatibility:
	    •	Algorithms require numerical input. Vectorization bridges the gap between raw text and numerical data.
	2.	Text Representation:
	    •	Converts words, phrases, or documents into vectors (mathematical objects) while retaining their semantic meaning as much as possible.
	3.	Facilitates Analysis:
	    •	Enables tasks like classification, clustering, similarity comparison, etc.

Methods of Vectorizing Text
	1.	Basic Approaches
        •	Bag of Words (BoW)
        •	TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
	2.	Contextual Approaches
        •	Word Embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe)
        •	Transformer-based Representations (e.g., BERT, GPT)

Choosing the Right Method
	•	BoW or TF-IDF: Best for small-scale projects, document classification, or text similarity where context is not critical.
	•	Word Embeddings (Word2Vec/GloVe): Useful for tasks needing semantic understanding (e.g., word similarity, clustering).
	•	Transformers (BERT/GPT): Best for sophisticated tasks requiring context, such as sentiment analysis, question answering, or summarization.
