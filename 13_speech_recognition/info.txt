1. Concept of Speech Recognition

Definition

Speech recognition (SR), also known as automatic speech recognition (ASR), refers to the process of converting spoken language into text using machine learning algorithms and signal processing techniques.

Goal

To accurately transcribe spoken words into text, enabling seamless interaction between humans and machines.

Applications
	•	Virtual Assistants: Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant.
	•	Transcription Services: Otter.ai, Rev.
	•	Accessibility Tools: Voice-to-text for hearing-impaired individuals.
	•	Customer Service: Automated call centers.
	•	Language Translation: Real-time speech-to-speech translation.

2. Techniques in Speech Recognition

Stages in Speech Recognition
	1.	Audio Signal Preprocessing:
	•	Converts raw audio signals into a digital format for further analysis.
	•	Removes background noise and normalizes volume.
	2.	Feature Extraction:
	•	Extracts meaningful patterns from audio signals (e.g., frequency, pitch).
	•	Techniques:
	•	MFCC (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients):
	•	Extracts features based on the human ear’s perception of sound.
	•	Spectrogram Analysis:
	•	Represents the frequency spectrum over time.
	•	PLP (Perceptual Linear Prediction):
	•	Models auditory perception more accurately.
	3.	Acoustic Modeling:
	•	Maps acoustic signals to phonemes (basic sound units of speech).
	•	Typically involves Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) or neural networks.
	4.	Language Modeling:
	•	Predicts the sequence of words using context.
	•	Probabilistic models like N-grams or deep learning-based approaches such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers are used.
	5.	Decoding:
	•	Combines acoustic and language models to predict the most likely word sequence.

3. Techniques in Speech Recognition

1. Rule-Based Systems (Legacy Approach)
	•	Use phonetic dictionaries and rules to transcribe speech.
	•	Limitations: Cannot adapt to new languages or dialects.

2. Statistical Models
	•	Leverage probability and statistics for acoustic and language modeling.
	•	Example: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs).

3. Deep Learning-Based Methods (Modern Approach)
	•	Neural networks learn patterns from large datasets without manual feature engineering.

4. Deep Learning in Speech Recognition

Neural Network Architectures
	1.	Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):
	•	Extract spatial features from spectrograms.
	2.	Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):
	•	Capture temporal dependencies in audio sequences.
	•	Variants like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and GRU are commonly used.
	3.	Transformer Models:
	•	Used for end-to-end speech recognition (e.g., Whisper by OpenAI).
	•	Self-attention mechanism captures long-term dependencies.
	4.	End-to-End Models:
	•	Replace traditional pipelines (feature extraction, acoustic modeling, etc.) with a unified deep learning model.
	•	Examples:
	•	CTC (Connectionist Temporal Classification):
	•	Aligns input audio frames with corresponding output text.
	•	Seq2Seq (Sequence-to-Sequence):
	•	Directly maps audio features to text.

6. Challenges in Speech Recognition
	1.	Accents and Dialects:
	•	Variability in pronunciation makes training models harder.
	2.	Background Noise:
	•	Distorts audio signals and reduces accuracy.
	3.	Contextual Understanding:
	•	Recognizing homophones (e.g., “two” vs. “too”).
	4.	Resource Limitations:
	•	Large datasets and computational resources are required.
	5.	Languages with Low Resources:
	•	Limited training data for less-spoken languages.

7. Applications of Speech Recognition
