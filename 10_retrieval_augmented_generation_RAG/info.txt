Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful paradigm in natural language processing (NLP) that combines retrieval-based methods and generative models to enhance the accuracy and relevance of language generation tasks. It addresses the limitation of traditional generative models by incorporating external knowledge from a retrieval system.

In building a RAG application, the system can be splitted into 3 components;
1. Indexing - This involves preparing the data and storing it in a specialized database
    emcompasses;
    * Document loading
    * Document Splitting
    * Document embeddings
    * Document storage
2. Retrieval - Involves retrirving only the documents most relevant toa user's request
3. Involves taking the user request with the retrived documents and employing an LLM to produce a context-aware response


Key Concepts of RAG
	1.	Generative Models
Models like GPT, T5, or BERT-based generators generate text based on input. However, they are limited by the information available in their pretrained weights, which might not include the latest or domain-specific knowledge.
	2.	Retrieval Mechanism
RAG integrates a retrieval mechanism that fetches relevant information (e.g., documents, passages) from an external knowledge base, database, or corpus. This ensures the generative model has access to up-to-date and context-specific information.
	3.	Fusion of Retrieval and Generation
The retrieved information is combined with the input query and passed to the generative model to produce a more informed response.

Architecture of RAG

A typical RAG architecture consists of the following components:
	1.	Retriever
	•	Responsible for fetching relevant documents or passages from an external corpus (e.g., using BM25, dense embeddings, or other retrieval techniques).
	•	Popular retrievers:
	•	BM25 (Sparse): Lexical matching-based retriever.
	•	Dense Retrieval: Embedding-based retriever using models like Sentence-BERT or Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR).
	2.	Reader (Generator)
	•	A pretrained language model (e.g., GPT, T5) generates text using the retrieved documents and the input query.
	3.	Scoring Mechanism
	•	Combines relevance scores from the retriever and the likelihood of the generative model to determine the best response.

Steps in the RAG Workflow
	1.	Input Query
A user query is provided as input (e.g., “What are the benefits of RAG?”).
	2.	Retrieve Relevant Documents
The query is passed to the retriever, which fetches top-K relevant documents or passages from an external knowledge base.
	3.	Augment the Query
The retrieved documents are concatenated or combined with the original query.
	4.	Generate a Response
The augmented input is passed to the generative model, which produces a response based on the query and the retrieved context.

Advantages of RAG
	1.	Incorporates Up-to-Date Knowledge
By relying on an external corpus, RAG models can provide answers based on the latest information, unlike traditional generative models with static training data.
	2.	Improved Contextual Relevance
Retrieval ensures that the generative model generates more accurate and relevant responses.
	3.	Efficient Use of Knowledge
By separating retrieval and generation, RAG can effectively scale across domains by swapping out the knowledge base.
	4.	Handles Long-Tail Questions
Retrieval allows the system to answer specific, rare, or domain-specific queries.

Challenges in RAG
	1.	Retriever Quality
The quality of the retriever significantly impacts the model’s performance. Poor retrieval can lead to irrelevant or incomplete answers.
	2.	Inference Latency
Combining retrieval and generation increases the complexity and time required for inference.
	3.	Knowledge Base Maintenance
The external knowledge base must be kept up-to-date and clean.
	4.	Hallucination
The generative model may still produce incorrect or fabricated responses if the retrieved documents are noisy.

Applications of RAG
	1.	Open-Domain Question Answering
RAG is commonly used for systems like ChatGPT with retrieval plugins, where accurate responses depend on external documents.
	2.	Customer Support
By integrating with company FAQs or documentation, RAG-based systems can provide precise responses to customer queries.
	3.	Medical and Legal Research
RAG ensures responses are backed by domain-specific and current knowledge.
	4.	Scientific Exploration
Researchers can use RAG to explore topics by querying against scientific databases.
