1. GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)

Key Features:
	•	Developed by: OpenAI.
	•	Primary Objective: Auto-regressive language modeling.
	•	GPT predicts the next word in a sequence, given the previous words.
	•	Focuses only on a left-to-right (causal) context.

Training:
	•	Pretrained using unsupervised learning on massive text corpora.
	•	Objective: Minimize the difference between predicted and actual next tokens.
	•	Fine-tuned for downstream tasks (e.g., text generation, summarization).

Strengths:
	•	Excels at generative tasks like text generation, creative writing, and summarization.
	•	Simple training objective (predict next word).

Limitations:
	•	Limited to a unidirectional (left-to-right) context.
	•	Struggles with tasks that require bidirectional understanding (e.g., sentence classification).


2. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)

Key Features:
	•	Developed by: Google AI.
	•	Primary Objective: Bidirectional context modeling.
	•	Unlike GPT, BERT considers both the left and right contexts of words in a sentence simultaneously.
	•	Pretrained using two tasks:
	•	Masked Language Modeling (MLM): Randomly masks some words, and the model predicts them.
	•	Next Sentence Prediction (NSP): Predicts whether one sentence follows another.

Training:
	•	Pretrained on massive datasets like Wikipedia and BooksCorpus.
	•	Fine-tuned for downstream tasks like classification, question answering, and entity recognition.

Strengths:
	•	Bidirectional context enables deeper understanding of text.
	•	Performs well on comprehension tasks like classification, NER, and question answering.

Limitations:
	•	Not suited for generative tasks (e.g., text generation).
	•	Masked word prediction is not directly useful for generating fluent text.


3. XLNet

Key Features:
	•	Developed by: Google Brain and Carnegie Mellon University.
	•	Primary Objective: Overcome the limitations of BERT and GPT by modeling bidirectional context without masking.

Training:
	•	Permutated Language Modeling (PLM):
	•	Unlike BERT, it does not mask tokens but considers all possible word order permutations during training.
	•	This allows the model to learn bidirectional context without relying on a masking mechanism.
	•	Auto-regressive and auto-encoding hybrid:
	•	Combines the strengths of GPT (auto-regressive) and BERT (bidirectional context).
	•	Handles sequence dependencies better than BERT.

Strengths:
	•	Avoids the pretrain-finetune discrepancy (BERT learns masked tokens, which doesn’t align with real-world tasks).
	•	Outperforms BERT on several benchmarks like SQuAD and GLUE.

Limitations:
	•	Computationally more expensive due to permutations.
	•	Larger model size and longer training time compared to BERT.


When to Use Each Model
	•	GPT: For creative, generative tasks like text completion, story writing, or summarization.
	•	BERT: For comprehension and analysis tasks like classification, NER, or question answering.
	•	XLNet: When performance on complex NLP tasks is critical and computational resources are available.
