# Lemmatization is the process of reducing a word to its base or dictionary 
# form, known as a lemma, while ensuring that the resulting word is 
# meaningful and grammatically correct. Unlike stemming, which can produce
#  non-words
# Lemmatization is a critical step in text preprocessing, especially for 
# tasks that require semantic understanding and accuracy. While itâ€™s slower 
# than stemming, it provides valid base forms of words, 
# making it preferable for high-precision NLP tasks.
